Air pollution is a pressing global challenge, demanding innovative solutions. This project developed a machine learning model to predict air quality based on meteorological factors and pollutant levels. By analyzing historical data and employing algorithms like Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, we created a model capable of forecasting air quality indices. The model was built using Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and model development. To enhance efficiency and reproducibility, we utilized the Anaconda environment and Jupyter Notebook. Rigorous evaluation using RMSE ensured optimal model performance. A user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and Flask was developed for easy interaction. This project holds the potential to inform decision-making, contribute to environmental sustainability, and improve public health.
