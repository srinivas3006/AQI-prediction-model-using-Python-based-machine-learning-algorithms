**Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) values based on historical meteorological and air quality data. The model will utilize a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to accurately forecast AQI levels.

**Data**

The dataset used for this project should contain the following information:

  * **Meteorological Data:**
      * Temperature
      * Humidity
      * Wind speed
      * Atmospheric pressure
      * Rainfall
  * **Air Quality Data:**
      * PM2.5
      * PM10
      * NO2
      * SO2
      * CO
      * O3

**Data Preprocessing**

1.  **Handling Missing Values:**
      * Identify and handle missing values using techniques like imputation or removal.
2.  **Feature Engineering:**
      * Create new features that might be relevant for prediction, such as:
          * Time-based features (e.g., hour, day of week, season)
          * Meteorological indices (e.g., relative humidity)
3.  **Data Splitting:**
      * Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

**Model Development**

1.  **Algorithm Selection:**
      * Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including:
          * Linear Regression
          * Decision Trees
          * Random Forest
          * Support Vector Regression
          * Neural Networks
2.  **Model Training:**
      * Train the selected model on the training dataset.
3.  **Model Evaluation:**
      * Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

**Deployment**

1.  **Model Deployment:**
      * Deploy the trained model to a suitable platform (e.g., cloud-based or local server).
2.  **API Development:**
      * Create an API to expose the model's prediction capabilities to other applications.
3.  **User Interface:**
      * Develop a user-friendly interface to visualize AQI predictions and historical data.

**Future Work**

  * **Real-time Predictions:**
      * Integrate real-time data sources to provide up-to-date AQI predictions.
  * **Ensemble Methods:**
      * Explore ensemble techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
  * **Uncertainty Quantification:**
      * Estimate the uncertainty associated with AQI predictions.
  * **Explainable AI:**
      * Develop techniques to understand the reasons behind model predictions.
